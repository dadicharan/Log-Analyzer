## 📌 Overview

This project is built to assist developers, network analysts, and security teams in quickly understanding log data and detecting suspicious patterns using AI. It offers:

- Easy file upload (CSV logs)
- Timestamp-based activity graphs
- Column-wise log analysis
- AI chatbot for anomaly detection
- Smart querying with natural language

🧠 AI Chatbot Instructions
Once a CSV log file is uploaded:

Select a column or timestamp range

Use the chat interface to ask natural language questions like:

"What errors occurred the most?"

"Find any suspicious login attempts."

"Summarize unusual spikes."

"Explain high activity periods."

The chatbot responds using DeepSeek LLM to summarize patterns and anomalies.

📝 Usage Guide
Upload a .csv log file (make sure it has headers).

Choose the time and data columns for visualizations.

Interact with the AI assistant using questions related to the data.

Review charts and chatbot insights on the same dashboard.
